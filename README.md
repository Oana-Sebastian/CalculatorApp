# C-CalculatorApp

CalculatorApp is a WPF-based calculator application built in C# using the MVVM design pattern. It emulates the standard Windows Calculator and includes additional features from the Programmer variant, making it a versatile tool for everyday calculations and programming-related numeral conversions.

#Features
  * Standard Operations:
      - Supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
  * Additional Operations:
      - Includes operations like square root, reciprocal (1/x), square, percentage, and sign inversion (+/-).
  * Memory Functions:
      - Offers memory controls (MC, MR, M+, M-, MS, Mv) with the same behavior as the Windows Calculator.
  * Digit Grouping:
      - Automatically groups digits (e.g., 30000 is displayed as 30,000) based on the current culture. Digit grouping is applied in real time as you enter numbers, and all decimal places are preserved.
  * Error Handling:
      - Robust error management that displays "Error" (e.g., on division by zero) and disables further operations until the error is cleared.
  * Programmer Mode:
      - Provides conversion functionalities between numeral systems (binary, octal, decimal, hexadecimal) with input validation.
  * Custom Cut/Copy/Paste:
      - Implements custom text manipulation for cut, copy, and paste operations without relying on the pre-built textbox functionalities.
  * Keyboard & Mouse Input:
      - Fully supports input via both keyboard and mouse.
  * State Persistence:
      - Remembers the last used settings (digit grouping and mode) between sessions.
#Technologies
  * WPF & XAML: For building a modern, non-resizable UI that mimics the Windows Calculator.
  * C# & .NET: Core programming language and platform.
  * MVVM Pattern: To separate UI from business logic and enhance maintainability.
#Getting Started
  * Prerequisites
      - Visual Studio with the .NET desktop development workload.
      - .NET Framework or .NET Core (depending on your project settings).
#Installation
  * Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CalculatorApp.git
  * Open the solution file (CalculatorApp.sln) in Visual Studio.
  * Build the project and run it to see the Calculator in action.

# Usage
  * Basic Calculations:
      - Use the number pad and operation buttons to perform calculations.
  * Error Handling:
      - If an error occurs (for example, division by zero), the display will show "Error" and operator buttons will be disabled until you clear the error using the C/CE buttons.
  * Digit Grouping:
      - As you enter numbers, digit grouping is automatically applied based on your system's culture settings, making large numbers easier to read.
  * Programmer Mode:
      - Switch to programmer mode to convert numbers between binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal bases.
